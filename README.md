**THE CHALLENGE | SPOT THAT FIRE V2.0**

Your challenge is to create an application that leverages NASA's near-real-time and archival wildfire datasets along with other tools to support firefighting and fire mitigation efforts. This challenge builds on last yearâ€™s challenge of the same name by calling for innovative ideas and apps that focus on how to engage and enable citizens to assist with the entire firefighting and fire mitigation process.

The app was conceived with the idea of "the action must be as fast as possible". With this in mind, we built our designs with intuitive interfaces for faster information providing.

The app has two main modes: `user mode` and `fireman mode`.

In the user mode, people can report fires in their location, or see if there's any danger in their neighborhood. Also, the user mode provides information on how to proceed in these situations.

In the fireman mode, they can receive reports in a rank, based on many variables, as proximity and number of reports per area. In the future, the plan is to include information provided by satellite (on larger fires), local sensors, and have a prediction system based on local temperature and electric installations.

The group used **Adobe XD** for prototyping and the implementation was made on **React Native** and **Firebase** plataforms.
